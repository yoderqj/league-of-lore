**Trolls** are a grotesque, humanoid species that inhabit the Freljord and [[league of lore/world locations/Shurima\|Shurima]]. **Frost-trolls** of the [[Freljord\|Freljord]] are mostly blue-skinned and live in tribes. Lately, the frost-trolls have begun preparing for war, rallying under the banner of trundle, the Troll King. There are also **sand-trolls** that live in Shurima and ixtal and **giant-trolls** scattered across [Valoran](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Valoran "Valoran"). It is unknown how many sand-trolls and giant-trolls are still extant, as their kind are considered a myth in modern times.
