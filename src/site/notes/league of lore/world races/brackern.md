# brackern

Their form is dominated by a gray carapace that bears a striking resemblance to stonework, providing them with natural armor and camouflage in their rocky habitats.

The Brackern tails, each adorned with a stinger at the end, allows them to both carve out and handle large boulders with precision. In addition to their physical strength, the Brackern possess innate magical abilities, particularly in the manipulation of earth and stone. Through a combination of magic and the use of their claws, the Brackern can command the very earth itself. They are capable of digging intricate tunnels and caverns with ease, shaping the terrain to suit their needs. Furthermore, they can summon earthen barriers to shield themselves from harm, making them formidable adversaries in battle.

They speak through vibrational tones that, when heard, resonate within the listener's mind, transcending linguistic barriers. This unique form of communication allows them to interact seamlessly with other species.Â 

The brood mothers, the matriarchal figures within the collective of the Brackern, carry their offspring on their backs, nurturing them until they are ready to safely leave their mother's back.

The full name of a Brackern consists of their first name, which clan they are part of, and whom they are the progeny of
