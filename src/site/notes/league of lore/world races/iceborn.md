# iceborn
**Iceborn** is a rare magical alteration that makes the individual more resistant to the cold and grants them the ability to manipulate both True Ice and Dark Ice. It is the result of an ancient and terrible bargain made by Lisandra to grant those powers for her sisters and followers. The vast majority of known Iceborn are humans, though the Three Sisters had Iceborn followers from different races

Thought to be a rare phenomenon, the blood of the tribes has been known to carry the power of this bargain. Very few Iceborn exist today, though the title and ability to work with ice are both heritable (can be passed down through generations and mostly consistently from the mother to her child).
