# yordles

Yordles come from self-contained pockets within the spirit realm, with no direct "mirror" in the material realm of Runeterra. The origin of this race on Runeterra is unknown but can be traced back to a prehistoric time when there were no civilizations on land thanks to the existence of [Fizz](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Fizz "Fizz"), an amphibious yordle. Most would agree that Yordles resided on [Valoran](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Valoran "Valoran") during its prehistoric times. At that time they were a nomadic race, travelling from one part of Valoran to the other. Records show they had presence in [Ancient Freljord](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Freljord "Freljord"). They lived in tight neat family groups as well as near early humans. Because of their small stature, they were mostly prey for many animals. During prehistoric times they had tails and front canine teeth.

Overtime as human civilizations advanced, so did yordles' appearances and capabilities. To easily blend in human areas, yordles at one point started using an ability called "Glamour", which gave them the appearance of short humans.

To this day, most yordles stay inside the mystical spiritual realm known as [Bandle City](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Bandle_City "Bandle City"), only venturing out on rare occasions. There are numerous gateways across Runeterra that yordles, and other knowledgeable and perceptive individuals, are able to use to get to in and out of Bandle City.
