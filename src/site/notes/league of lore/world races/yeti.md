# yeti
The **Yeti** are a mammalian species of ancient magical beings that inhabited the Freljord during the [War of the Three Sisters](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Three_Sisters "War of the Three Sisters"). They were the only beings able to create true ice. The Yeti were intelligent, peaceful and playful beings that used to live in harmony with other creatures, like the  yordles

When Lisandra stole the **Yeti**'s magic to seal away the void, the Yeti regressed back to their more aggressive and violent state known as the **Wild Yeti**.
