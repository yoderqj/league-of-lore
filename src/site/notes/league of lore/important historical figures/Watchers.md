# Watchers

don't wanna exist so you cant either.

the watchers are gods from another plane of existence. they do not enjoy the feeling of knowing they exist which is why they want to destroy Runeterra. they can happily go back to not being aware that they exist if nothing is there to observe them. 

these beings are what create the Voidborn creatures that wish to consume Runeterra. currently no watcher has ever been killed but that's also because they do not wish to interact with the world. that doesn't mean they have not. one watcher came forward to Runeterra many years ago in what is now his prison the howling abyss. this watcher was sealed there by Lisandra after she stole the ability to create true ice from the yetis which she trapped the watcher in. currently it is only a matter of time till that watcher escapes again.
