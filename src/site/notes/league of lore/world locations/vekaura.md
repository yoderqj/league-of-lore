# vekaura

Vekaura is a city located in southern Shurima. A city built on the confluence of Mother of Life and Kahleek rivers.

 **Sun Disc Replica:** The prize of the city is the ornate, non-magical, replica of the Sun Disc, built to honor Shurima's fallen and as a statement of hope that the sun might one day bless them again. A sun temple built of chiseled sandstone and bare rock. Raised by human hands to human scale. The walls were black and gleamed like basalt, though uneven joints could be seen between panels where they had been fixed to the rough stone beneath. A sun disc gleamed atop the temple, but it was not fashioned from gold, but wrought from alloyed bronze and copper. It did not float, instead, braided ropes tied to asymmetrical pillars on either side of the disc held it aloft.

In Ancient times, Stepped gardens and flowers brought from every corner of the empire garlanded its structures in vivid colors and wondrous scents. Its towers gleamed with silver and jade, and cool water flowed from the great temple, running along great aqueducts

vekaura was a wealthy city compared to its neighbors and was far enough away from [[league of lore/world locations/shamesh\|shamesh]] that they had a relative degree of freedom. they also were favored by the rulers of shamesh due to their reverence and allegiance to the sun disc and the the Shuriman empire. they contributed to the academic studies of the Shuriman empire by keeping detailed historical records as well as research which was all kept in a large library called the vekauran maktaba.
