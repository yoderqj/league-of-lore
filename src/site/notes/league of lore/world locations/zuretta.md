# zuretta
 zuretta is a small town in the great-sai. they are large enough to be recognizable on a map but due to their remote location and far distance from [[league of lore/world locations/shamesh\|shamesh]] they are a primate and small town with very little trade opportunity. rather they typically act as a refuge for those who chose to cross the great-sai.
