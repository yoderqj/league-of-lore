# (7000-6000 BN)

- The [[league of lore/important historical figures/Watchers\|league of lore/important historical figures/Watchers]] who didn’t get the chance to try crossing over in to Runeterra are horrified at what happened, and though they're unaware of the specifics, they're very aware of the fact they’ve been betrayed.
-  They realize they can’t just enter Runeterra freely, and create a new plan: create [[Voidborn\|Voidborn]] to enter Runeterra for them.
- [[league of lore/important historical figures/Vel’Koz\|league of lore/important historical figures/Vel’Koz]] is created, and sets out doing what [[Voidborn\|Voidborn]] do; consuming everything living or magical in its way, eventually growing to become terrifyingly intelligent and powerful. He takes the task of feeding information about the world back to the Watchers, to keep them informed.
- The [[league of lore/world races/yeti\|yeti]] become savage beasts without their magic, ending their civilization.
- Willump is the only [[league of lore/world races/yeti\|yeti]] to keep his magic, so he guards what little remains of the yeti’s ancient power from then on. People try to claim it from him, resulting in him transforming in to a brutish monster like his kin. He would endure like this for millennia.
