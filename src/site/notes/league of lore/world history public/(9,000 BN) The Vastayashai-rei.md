# (9,000 BN) The Vastayashai-rei

- A race of titans from beyond the sky (presumably the Celestial Realm) attack Ionia, negatively affecting the balance between the Material and Spirit Realms.
- Several mortals use knowledge from their ancestors to tap in to the Spirit Realm and draw its power in to themselves, becoming the Vastayashai’rei.
- They return to living among their mortal kin, and breed back in to the mortal population. This creates the vastaya.
- The Vastayashai’rei’s power eventually dwindles as the balance of the realms is restored, and the vastaya expand across Runeterra in various tribes named after individual Vastayashai’rei. The timeframe for this is unknown
