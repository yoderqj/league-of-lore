# pre-timeline


- An unknown group of celestial entities use the World Runes to create the realm of Runeterra. Runeterra is left incomplete, though how, and why, is unknown.
-  Runeterra exists as two realms: the Material Realm and Spirit Realm. The Material Realm is the physical part of Runeterra, composed of elemental magic and the physical world, while the Spirit Realm is its spiritual counterpart, containing the souls of every one, every thing, every place and every feeling. These two realms mirror each other and affect each other.
- Kindred comes to be.
- The Freljordian demi-gods, among them Ornn, Anivia, Valhir (aka the Volibear), the Iron Boar, the Clever Lynx, the Seal Sister and a currently unidentified two-headed raven, come in to being and shape the ancient Freljord, which was then known as Vorrijaard, before the rise of mortals.
-  Maokai is born along with the Blessed Isles as they are formed from a volcanic eruption at sea. He uses the magical waters beneath the isles to fill them with life.
-  Various sentient species develop cultures and societies across the world, including [[humans\|humans]], [[yordles\|yordles]], [[trolls\|trolls]], [[minotaurs\|minotaurs]], [[league of lore/world races/brackern\|league of lore/world races/brackern]] and [[yeti\|yeti]].
