# shamesh

shamesh is the capitol city of Shurima where the empress lives along with the ascendant hosts. the city is gigantic and very wealthy especially when compared to other regions in the Shuriman coalition. much of this is due to the protection that the ascendant host provide to other members of Shurima which in tern nets them those regions technological adamants.  the city boasts impressively comprehensive irrigation systems that have nullified the fear of the harsh desert environment. with no fear of drought or food shortages the people within  shamesh live comfortable lives wholly unaware of how much harder life is for the surrounding nations. because of this many members of the coalition of Shurima carry a passive distain for shameshs people, though such sentiments would never be vocalized due to the governments willingness to make a show of force which only compounds this disdain.

shamesh as stated before is a city with rigid laws and very defined social hierarchy's. as such the most concerning thing to citizens in this area is less survival or monetary needs but status especially in the wealthier brackets. the super rich of shamesh bend over backwards in service of the empress, both to ensure their monetary and political power is kept but also out of fear. the empress of shamesh or rather of all Shurima is [[league of lore/important historical figures/Setaka\|setaka]] said to be the strongest of the ascendant hosts. 

shamesh is a city "free of crime and want" this comes at the cost of a very heavy handed government. massive acts of rebellion are crushed instantaneously by shemeshs ascendant which are a major deterrent to crime often the mere sight of one of the ascendant hosts is enough to make even the most determined of criminals waver. because of this important or very wealthy areas often have ascendant in the areas either parting in the lavish novelties of the aristocrats or standing guard.
