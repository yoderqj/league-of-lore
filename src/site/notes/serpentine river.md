The **Serpentine River** is a vast river network located in Shuriman jungle of the Shuriman continent . The river starts in the east of the Jungle, directly connecting with the The Mother of Life river of Shurima and ends with a large river delta, slicing the entire Jungle to North and South. The denizens of the river delta have close ties with surrounding settlements as well as bilgewater and the serpent isles.
